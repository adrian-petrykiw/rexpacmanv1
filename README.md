Get started
===========

To just run the game locally, run `npm start`.
If you want to see the console logs in your browser, use the `npm run start:dev` instead.

To modify the game for your needs, look at the `pacman-canvas.js` file and make your modifications.
To change the look and feel, edit the `pacman-canvas.css` file or also the `index.htm`file, where everything comes together.
